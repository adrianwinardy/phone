<h1>Learning 	Numbers</h1>
	<p>As explained in the introduction, the manual numerals around the world are not universal. Signed languages have their own signs for the numbers. Some manual numerals are one-handed and some are two-handed systems.
 </p>

<h1>Palm in or out</h1>
<p>When learning numbers in ASL there are rule that is applied, which is palm in or out. You must face your palm to yourself for the cardinal numbers one through five, but it comes to a different rule when telling ages. That is, your palm faces out for the ages one through five.</p>
<p>For the numbers six through nine, your palm is out -- facing outward from the signer's perspective.</p>
<p>For the numbers eleven through fifteen, your palm is in. For the rest of the numbers except for the number 21, the palm is out.</p>
<h1>The 20-29</h1>
<p>The numbers 20 through 29 have different handshapes from the number two. So better practice on these numbers more. Use the "L" handshape for the "2" part from 23 to 29.</p>

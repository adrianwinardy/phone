			<h2>Why can’t there be universal sign language?</h2>
				<p>If we did develop a universal spoken or sign language and were able to teach it to everyone and persuade them to use it on a regular basis, we would find that the language soon changed. The creation of new slang phrases and various dialects almost overnight led to the return of diverse languages spoken throughout the world. Language is evolving and always will be.</p>	
			<h2>Is sign language the same in other countries?</h2>
				<p>There is no universal sign language. Different sign languages are used in different countries or regions. 
				Some countries adopt features of ASL in their sign languages.</p>
